step 1
Here, we initialize an array of objects called data, which contains information about different products,
including their id, name,img (image URL), price, and cat (category).


step 2 Selecting DOM Elements
We use document.querySelector to select and store references to various HTML elements:

productsContainer: The container where products will be displayed.
searchInput: The input field for searching products.
categoriesContainer: The container for displaying product categories.
priceRange: The input element for setting the price range.
priceValue: The element that displays the current price range value.



step 3 Displaying Products
displayProducts: This function takes an array of filteredProducts and generates HTML to display each product.
productsContainer.innerHTML: Sets the inner HTML of the productsContainer to the generated HTML string.
filteredProducts.map(...): Maps over the array of products and returns a string of HTML for each product.
.join(""): Joins the array of HTML strings into a single HTML string.
displayProducts(data): Calls the function initially with the full product list.
